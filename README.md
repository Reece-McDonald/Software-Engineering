	Ga1ors

Project Description:
	Ga1ors is a community based chat forum for the University of Florida. The 1 within the word "Ga1ors" refers to the 1.0% of the UF student population.
	Everyday the forum can contain X amount of posts, where X is the equivalent to 1% of the student population. At the end of each day, the forum is wiped clean and users rush to be part of the 1% to populate the forum.
	Users can post advertisements, stories, jokes, or any blog-related content they desire. As the name "Gators" implies, only accounts with a valid ufl.edu email address can post to this forum.
	The idea is to keep the websitelocally centered and created by UF students. Despite the exclusivity, no login is required to view the contents of the forum.
	At its core, Ga1ors is a social media app used to generate dialogue outside of its confines. Each day the community is not only given a platform to speak to the masses, but given a topic of conversation on how the random minority choose to use it.
